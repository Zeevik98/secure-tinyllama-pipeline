# Secure TinyLlama CI/CD Pipeline

A comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for deploying TinyLlama models with robust security features. This project implements a zero-trust security model utilizing AWS EKS for security scanning and AWS SageMaker for model deployment.

## Project Overview

This pipeline provides an end-to-end solution for securely deploying TinyLlama models, featuring:

- Automated security scanning using SonarQube and OWASP ZAP
- Secure model deployment through AWS SageMaker
- Zero Trust networking principles with Istio service mesh
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting system
- GitOps-based deployment using ArgoCD

## Architecture

The system is built on several key components:

### Security Infrastructure
- AWS EKS cluster running security tooling
- Network policies implementing Zero Trust principles
- Istio service mesh with mTLS encryption
- Pod Security Standards enforcement

### Model Deployment
- SageMaker endpoints for model serving
- Automated testing environments
- Dynamic security validation
- Production deployment safeguards

### Monitoring & Observability
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards
- CloudWatch integration
- Automated alerting system

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- GitHub account with repository access
- Terraform installed locally
- kubectl configured for EKS access

### Deployment Steps
1. Configure AWS credentials
2. Update Terraform variables
3. Execute deployment script
4. Verify security configurations
5. Deploy initial model

Detailed deployment instructions can be found in the `/docs` directory.

## Security Features

This pipeline implements several layers of security:
- Code scanning with SonarQube
- Dynamic security testing with OWASP ZAP
- Network isolation using AWS VPC
- Kubernetes pod security policies
- Service mesh encryption
- Least privilege access controls
